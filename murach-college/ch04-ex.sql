-- InstructorDept: The DepartmentName column from the Departments table for an instructor
-- LastName: The LastName column from the Instructors table
-- FirstName: The FirstName column from the Instructors table
-- CourseDescription: The CourseDescription column from the Courses table
-- CourseDept: The DepartmentName column from the Departments table for a course
-- Return one row for each course that’s in a different department than the department 
-- of the instructor assigned to teach that course. (Hint: You will need to join the 
-- Departments table to both the Instructors table and the Courses table, which will 
-- require you to use table aliases to distinguish the two tables.)
